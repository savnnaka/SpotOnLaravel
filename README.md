## About This Laravel Project

Idea

An website, which allows authorized users to search for events in their city. They can comment on events, like them or subscribe to the initiator of the event (the so-called 'organizer'). This leads to an unique feet with all the events of the organizers that one user follows. Organizer themselves can create, read, edit and update events on their page.

Features

- Multi-Authentication: users vs. organizers
- Email-Verification for both users and organizers
- CRUD-Functionalities: creating, reading, updating (and deleting) events and one's profile
- Includes editor to edit events
- Images are stored as base64 in database
